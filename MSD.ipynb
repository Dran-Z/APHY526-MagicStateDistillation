    "## Why do we need MSD?\n",
    "Quantum computers are regarded as promising platform to outperform classical computers on certain problems. However, real-world quantum computers are subject to various kind of quantum noise that could decohere quantum information and prevent us from gaining quantum advantages. Therefore, quantum computers must be made fault-tolerant in order to obtain robustness to quantum noise, and we need Quantum Error Correcting (QEC) codes to preserve quantum information in the logical qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although QEC codes allow to preserve quantum information in a fault-tolerant way, we would usually more like to process quantum information rather than just keep it in stationary memories. The quantum operation, surely, should also be fault-tolerant to avoid undesirable error propagation between different subsystems. A natural way to process quantum information is the so-called *transversal* operations, which means the logical operations are implemented by the physical operations implemeneted on each subsystem. For example, a logical CNOT gate between two logical qubits can be implemented by pair-wise physical CNOT gates between these two blocks:\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Transversality grants fault-tolerance naturally, as there won't be correlated errors cascaded from single local error. However, transversality is a too good property to be the golden solution for QEC. In 2009, Eastin and Knill proposed a no-go theorem, showing that no transversal gate sets can achieve universality in any QEC codes. Universal gate sets mean that we can implement arbitrary quantum computation with gates from the given gate sets, and universality has been considered to be a necessity for realistic quantum advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clifford gates are these gate that maps Pauli operators to Pauli operators, and they can be generated by gate set $\\{H, S, CNOT\\}$. In many common codes, Clifford gate sets are transversal. Nevertheless, quantum circuits composed of only Clifford gates are also proved to be efficiently simulable with classical computers and bring no quantum advantages. Because of the no-go theorem, we therefore believe the non-Clifford resources are the *magic* ingredient from classical regime to quantum advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that non-Clifford gates cannot be implemented transverally simultaneously with the Clifford gates, we usually believe that we must suffer a certain amount of noise when we apply logical non-Clifford gates. To circumvent this case, Bravyi and Kitaev proposed the *Magic State Distillation (MSD)* in 2005, which transfer the overhead for implementing high-quality non-Clifford gates to preparing high-fidelity non-Clifford states (or magic states) with a technique called gate injection. By consuming a high-fidelity copy of non-Clifford resource state, we can implemented a $T$ gate on the quantum circuit with only fault-tolerant operations.\n",

    "Therefore, as long as we have access to the high-fidelity magic states, we can achieve universal quantum computation together with fault-tolerant Clifford operations.\n",

    "## What is MSD?\n",
    "In MSD, we often start with a stable supply of moderate-fidelity magic states. We are aim to \"distill\" these raw states into higher fidelity states with only Clifford operations, measurements and classical processing. The process can somehow be regarded as an error-correcting process, but not exactly the same. Most MSD protocols can be described by stabilizer codes, and I will start by introducing the $[[5, 1, 3]]$ codes to show how we distill a faulty magic state into a better one.\n"
